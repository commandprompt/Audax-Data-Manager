# Audax Data Manager
*(formerly PgManage)*

![Audax Data Manager Banner](/artwork/readme_banner.png)

**Audax Data Manager** is a free, open-source database client and administration tool
for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, SQLite, and Oracle — all from one app, so
you don't need a different tool per database. It's a database manager that does not get
in your way.

- **One client, six databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, SQLite, and
  Oracle — no more switching tools per engine.
- **Free & open source (MIT license).** No license fees, source available on GitHub.
- **Privacy-first:** zero tracking, zero telemetry — we respect our users.
- **Actively developed:** a new release every 6–8 weeks.
- **Trusted by the community:** 1,100+ GitHub stars and 8,000+ downloads.
